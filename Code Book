The Code Book contains information on making a tidy data set from the data contained in the 'Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset' experiments.
STUDY DESIGN
  The study was done by:
    Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory
    DITEN - Universit√† degli Studi di Genova.
    Via Opera Pia 11A, I-16145, Genoa, Italy.

  The .zip file below also has a nice README document with full details
THE DATA
  The data was obtained from the following website:https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
  The data consisted or measurements (561) of different activity (6) on 30 subject (divided into 2 sets - train and test).
  There were 10299 rows of data in the data sets.
  The data was contained in:
    2 text files for the measurement data - 'test/X_test.txt', 'train/X_train.txt' (numeric)
    2 text files for the activity labels - 'test/y_test.txt', 'train/y_train.txt' (integer)
    2 text files for the subjects - 'test/subject_test.txt', 'train/subject_train.txt' (inter)
    1 text file that named the 561 measurements being record, 'features.txt' (text)
    The data was spread out over these 7 text file data sets.

The purpose of this project is to:
  1. Merge the test and train data sets.
  2. Select a subset of measurements from the data (measurements on mean() and std() only)
  3. Use descriptive names to label the activities: "Walking","Walking upstairs", "Walking downstairs", "Sitting", "Standing", "Laying"
  4. Use descriptive names to label the measurements,i.e. - "tBodyAcc-mean()-X", " tBodyAcc-std()-X", etc.
  5. Creates second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject 
      This tidy data frame consisted of 66 measurements on 30 subjects for 6 activities, or a dim(180,66)
  
CODE BOOK
  Step 1.)
    testset - data set containing test subject measurement data
    trainset - data set containing train subject measurement data
    totalset - merge (rbind) of testset and trainset data
  
    testlabel - data set containing test subject integer
    trainlabel - data set containing train subject integer
    totallabel - merge (rbind) of testlabel and trainlabel data (integer)
  Step 2.)
    features - data set containing the text name for the measures 
    MeanStdInd - the indices for selecting only the mean() and std() measurements
    MeanStdIndSrt - the sorted indices set
    totalsetMnStd - the measurement data set with only the select measuremenst
  Step 3.)
    totallabelTxt - the data set with the descriptive activity name 
    totalsetMnStdAct - the measurement data set with the descriptive activity name column added
  Step 4.) 
    totalsetMnStdActLab - the measurement data set with the descriptive measurement name added
  Step 5.)
    SubjectTrain - data set containing the train subjects (integer)
    SubjectTest - data set containing the test subjects (integer)
    totalSubject - merge (rbind) of SubjectTrain and SubjectTest
    totalsetMnStdActLabSub - the measurement data set with subject column added
    totalsetMnStdActLabSubIntact - the measurement data set with the activity (integer) column added
      Note: This variable is used in the logical statement for selection of a specific activity for a specific subject
    TidyData - the tidy data set that was built from the totalsetMnStdActLabSubIntact
    ActivityTxt - the string vector of the 6 activities
    RowNames - the string vector built to rename row names in TidyData data.frame with subject and activity
