The Code Book contains information on making a tidy data set from the data contained in the 'Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset' experiments.
THE DATA
The data was obtained from the following website:https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
The data consisted or measurements (561) of different activity (6) on 30 subject (divided into 2 sets - train and test).
There were 10299 rows of data in the data sets.
The data was contained in:
  2 text files for the measurement data - 'test/X_test.txt', 'train/X_train.txt' (numeric)
  2 text files for the activity labels - 'test/y_test.txt', 'train/y_train.txt' (integer)
  2 text files for the subjects - 'test/subject_test.txt', 'train/subject_train.txt' (inter)
  1 text file that named the 561 measurements being record, 'features.txt' (text)
The data was spread out over these 7 text file data sets.
The purpose of this project was to:
  1. Merge the test and train data sets.
  2. Select a subset of measurements from the data (measurements on mean() and std() only)
  3. Use descriptive names to label the activities: "Walking","Walking upstairs", "Walking downstairs", "Sitting", "Standing", "Laying"
  4. Use descriptive names to label the measurements,i.e. - "tBodyAcc-mean()-X", " tBodyAcc-std()-X", etc.
  5. Creates second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject 
      This tidy data frame consisted of 66 measurements on 30 subjects for 6 activities, or a dim(180,66)
